# .import files are made by Godot because the assets are exposed if using symlinks.
# IF you need to persist a .import file because of something used Godot-side (GUI-side),
# you can do a negation with !.
*.import
# Negation would be like this:
#!/Textures/UserInterface/1pxwhite.png.import
!/Scenes/SS14Window/closewindow.png.import
/I_MADE_THE_SYMLINK
