# Space Station 14 [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ygb7t8hsj3wt7pnm/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Silvertorch5/space-station-14/branch/master) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/space-wizards/space-station-14.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/space-wizards/space-station-14) [![Coverage](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=ss14&metric=coverage)](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=ss14)

Space Station 14 is a revived attempt at an SS13 remake.

**This repository is the *engine* section of SS14. This is the base engine all SS14 servers will be built on. As such, it does not start on its own: it needs the [content repo](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14-content). Use said repo for actual development, even if you're modifying the engine itself.**
